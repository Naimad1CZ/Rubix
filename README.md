# Rubix
This program solves a Rubik's cube the way how begginers solves it.
It is written in Czech language (however e.g. move notation is the same).
It is recommended to see notation("Notace") and the way how to solve the cube ("NÃ¡vod") before running the program.
It is written for Windwos users.
